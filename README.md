My BTP, trying to do it in React and Redux. VanillaJS became too much data to manage and update stuff.


TODO:

OH FUCK. should have handled adding to own attributes before :P stuff is broken. still committing just coz.

  * clear out the own Attributes from the deleted layers and shapes though.
  * handle editing of an inherited attribute. transfer it to an own attribute and prevent rerender because I guess that is going to be a problem. editing can be done from a name or an expression string.
  * handle codemirror marks man.
  * should we begin anchors/snapping first or set up charting first?
