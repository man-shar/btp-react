**TODO**
* codemirror doesn't render same mark consecutively on delete, drag drop.

* um, things don't update when other things update. plis. do something.

* initialise rectangle's x and y as reference attribtues:
---* x = index from shape's index and a function of width of the bar
---* y = chart height - height of the rect

* Add DragLayer component for showing component while dragging.
* clear out the own Attributes from the deleted layers and shapes though.

* just display columns in data. remove rows. 
* heirarchy in side bar.
* initialise chart width and height as referred attributes of x, y axis domain. add domains as attributes in the axes.

* check for cyclic reference in reference attributes.
* colorbrewer palletes
* add padding in chart width/height. make them as reference attributes of padding.

* um, have to figure out something about the y axis inversion.


FEEDBACK
* initialise each layer with different colour
* add context when rollover
* user scaffolding
