**TODO**
* initialise rectangle's x and y as reference attribtues:
---* x = index from shape's index and a function of width of the bar
---* y = chart height - height of the rect

* dragging column header in sheet.

* Add DragLayer component for showing component while dragging.
* clear out the own Attributes from the deleted layers and shapes though.
* should we begin anchors/snapping first or set up charting first?
